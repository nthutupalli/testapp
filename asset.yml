#       - ...etc...

# * note
#   ado uses only git, and all its repositories are named
#   tfs tfvc repositories do not have a name since they are unique to the project
#   tfs git repos for projects that use a single project-unique git repo,
#      like /<collection>/_git/<project-name>, should have the repository name
#      match the project name
#   tfs git repos that are in a tfs team project that has a tfvs project at its
#     root will be named, however. /<collection>/<team-project>/_git/<repository>
